# About
A Unity aircraft simulation game created in April 2022

A test demo in aircraft simulation and missile guidance.

Aircraft mechanism and aircraft weaponry were the main focus of this Unity project. Texturing, gameplay, and story came after. Overall, there could be improvements on terrain, aircraft limitations, missile limitations, and other things that can't happen in real life, like thrust to altitude relationship (AKA you shouldn't be able to fly to space).

Some assets and textures ripped from *Ace Combat 7*.
UI style based on *Project Wingman*'s UI Style.
