# About
A Unity aircraft simulation game created in April 2022

A test demo in aircraft simulation and missile guidance.

Aircraft mechanism and aircraft weaponry were the main focus of this Unity project. Texturing, gameplay, and story came after. Overall, there could be improvements on terrain, aircraft limitations, missile limitations, and other things that can't happen in real life, like thrust to altitude relationship (AKA you shouldn't be able to fly to space).

Some assets and audio ripped from *Ace Combat 7*.
UI style based on *Project Wingman*'s UI Style.

Feel free to copy the missile code, it's actually really good missile guidance. Maybe modify a few values to make more sense.
